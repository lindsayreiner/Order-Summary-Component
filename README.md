## My process

The challenge for myself was to not use any CSS frameworks to design this page so all styling was done with pure CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had some challenges with alignment of the different components that made up the card, and its overall positioning on the page. Solidified knowledge on these topics.
