## My process

The challenge for myself was to not use any CSS frameworks to design this page so all styling was done with pure CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

I had some challenges with alignment of the different components that made up the card, and its overall positioning on the page.
